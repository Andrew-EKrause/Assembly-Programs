# *MIPS Assembly Programs*

## Description
**_Several Simple Programs in the MIPS Assembly Language_** <br/>
This repository contains six simple programs written in the MIPS Assembly language. MIPS is an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. It was developed by Dr. John Hennessey and his graduate students at Stanford University in the 1980s. MIPS is a low-level language that communicates more directly with the computer's hardware. The language is not built like most modern assembly languages given that it has been simplified for educational purposes. You can find more information about the MIPS Assembly language here: https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/mips/mal-introduction.html. The assembly language programs in this project are run in a simulator that is included in this repository as a Mars4_5.jar file. Each program performs a certain function such as adding up a seris of numbers, reversing an array, or recursively sorting an array. Details about each assembly program are shown below.

###### helloprogram0mips.asm
**_Simple Hello World Program_** <br/>

###### firstnumberlist.asm
**_Program that Lists Numbers_** <br/>
Blah blah...

###### indicesum.asm
**_Program that Sums the Numbers in an Array_** <br/>
Blah blah...

###### listnumbers.asm
**_Program that Lists Numbers with Additional Features_** <br/>

###### recursivesort.asm
**_Program that Recursively Sorts an Array_** <br/>
Blah blah...

###### simplesort.asm

# Running / Viewing the Project
## Mars (IDE)
1. Click on the green `Code` button in the righthand corner of the project page (See `Screenshot 1.0` below for more details).
2. Click the `Download Zip` option in the dropdown menu that appears after you click the green Code button.
3. Go to your `Downloads` on your computer and drag/move the zipped folder onto your Desktop or any location that is easy for you to access.
4. Double click on the zipped folder to open its contents. A folder called "Assembly-Programs-master" should appear in the same location as the zipped file after you double click the zipped file to open it.
5. Double click on the "Assembly-Programs-master" folder to see its contents. Then double click on the Mars4_5.jar file to open it.
6. IMPORTANT: You will likely get an error saying that the Mars4_5.jar file cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. to get over this issue, first navigate to your `System Preferences/Settings` on your computer (See `Screenshot 2.0` below for more details).
7. In your System Preferences/Settings, click on the `Security and Privacy` icon/settings (See `Screenshots 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0` below for more details).
8. Inside of the Security and Privacy settings, under the `General` tab, you should see a message that says: "Mars4_5.jar file was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer." Click the `Open Anyway` button, which should be appearing alongside the message. You should then be able to open the Mars4_5.jar file.
