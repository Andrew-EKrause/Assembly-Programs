# *MIPS Assembly Programs*

## Description
**_Several Simple Programs in the MIPS Assembly Language_** <br/>
This repository contains six simple programs written in the MIPS Assembly language. MIPS is an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. It was developed by Dr. John Hennessey and his graduate students at Stanford University in the 1980s. MIPS is a low-level language that communicates more directly with the computer's hardware. The language is not built like most modern assembly languages given that it has been simplified for educational purposes. You can find more information about the MIPS Assembly language here: https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/mips/mal-introduction.html. The assembly language programs in this project are run in a simulator that is included in this repository as a Mars4_5.jar file. Each program performs a certain function such as adding up a seris of numbers, reversing an array, or recursively sorting an array. Details about each assembly program are shown below the steps to setting up the Mars4_5.jar environment.

**Resources for Project:**
- MIPS Assembly Language
- Mars (IDE)

# Setting up Mars Envrionment
## Mars (IDE)
1. Click on the green `Code` button in the righthand corner of the project page (See `Screenshot 1.0` below for visual details).
2. Click the `Download Zip` option in the dropdown menu that appears after you click the green Code button.
3. Go to your `Downloads` on your computer and drag / move the zipped folder onto your Desktop or any location that is easy for you to access.
4. Double click on the zipped folder to open its contents. A folder called "Assembly-Programs-master" should appear in the same location as the zipped file after you double click the zipped file to open it.
5. Double click on the "Assembly-Programs-master" folder to see its contents. Then double click on the Mars4_5.jar file to open it.
6. IMPORTANT: You will likely get an error saying that the Mars4_5.jar file cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. To solve this issue, first navigate to your `System Preferences/Settings` on your computer (See `Screenshot 2.0` below for visual details).
7. In your System Preferences / Settings, click on the `Security and Privacy` icon/settings (See `Screenshots 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0` below for visual details).
8. Inside of the Security and Privacy settings, under the `General` tab, you should see a message that says: "Mars4_5.jar file was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer." Click the `Open Anyway` button, which should be appearing alongside the message. (See `Screenshot 6.0` below for visual details).
9. After clicking the "Open Anyway" button, you will likely get a message that asks if you are sure that you want to open the Mars4_5.jar file. Click the "Open" button on the message (See `Screenshot 7.0` below for visual details).
10. Your Mars4_5.jar file should now open on your computer. See `Screenshot 8.0` if you want to compare what your Mars workspace looks like compared to the attached screenshot (they should look very similar).
11. See the following project descriptions below this step to run whichever assembly program you would like using the Mars environment. 
12. IMPORTANT: I would recommend starting with the first program, which is "helloprogram0mips.asm". How you open the file in the Mars environment and run it is very similar to the other programs you can run in this project. However, "helloprgram0mips.asm" is the only assembly program that has detailed screenshots on opening and running it. The other programs follow the same process. If you are running a different program and cannot remember how to open a file, refer back to the "helloprogram0mips.asm" program screenshots to help.

# Running the Assembly Programs
### Program: helloprogram0mips.asm (Refer back to screenshots here if you get stuck on running the other programs)
**_Simple Hello World Program_** <br/>
The program, when run, prints out a simple "Hello World" message in the Mars "Run I/O" tab. The value of a variable is also printed out as it is changed in a loop within the program. Steps to running the program are listed below:

1. First, click on "File" in the Mars environemnt. Then click "Open". A window should open where you can select a .asm file to open in the Mars environment.

2. Navigate to the project folder you downloaded from this repository, and select the "helloprogram0mips.asm" file. Click "Open".
3. To run the program, click on the "Run" option at the top of the Mars environment window, and then click "Assemble"

### Program: firstnumberlist.asm
**_Program that Lists Numbers_** <br/>
Blah blah...

### Program: indicesum.asm
**_Program that Sums the Numbers in an Array_** <br/>
Blah blah...

### Program: listnumbers.asm
**_Program that Lists Numbers with Additional Features_** <br/>
Blah blah...

### Program: recursivesort.asm
**_Program that Recursively Sorts an Array_** <br/>
Blah blah...

### Program: simplesort.asm
**_Program that uses the Simple Sort Algorithm on Arrays_** <br/>
Blah blah...
