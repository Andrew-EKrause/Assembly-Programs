# *MIPS Assembly Programs*

## Description
**_Several Simple Programs in the MIPS Assembly Language_** <br/>
This repository contains six simple programs written in the MIPS Assembly language. MIPS is an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages. MIPS is a low-level language that communicates more directly with the computer's hardware. The language is not built like most modern assembly languages given that it has been simplified for educational purposes. More can be found about the MIPS Assembly language here: https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/mips/mal-introduction.html. The assembly language programs in this project are run in a simulator that is included in this repository as a Mars4_5.jar file. Each program performs a certain function such as adding up a seris of numbers, reversing an array, or recursively sorting an array. Details about each assembly program are shown below.
